# [Triangles!](http://hackers.cool/~margo/triangles.html)

A spin-off of my [squares](https://github.com/margo73465/squares) project, because [triangles are my favorite shape](https://soundcloud.com/alt-j/03-tessellate).

### Still to-do:

* This of some cool way for the triangles to disappear (I have been thinking about putting a timer on them so they disappear a set time after they appeared)
* Add animation to triangle appearance (like they are flopping over from previous triangle)
* Event loop
* Refactor functionally
